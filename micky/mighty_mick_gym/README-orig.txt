This application demonstrates a gesture-based remote control device using Nordic Edge AI Lab solution.

Application overview
********************

The gesture recognition application demonstrates how to use an nRF Edge AI model to recognize hand gestures from motion sensor data and expose them as standard HID inputs over Bluetooth® Low Energy.
There are two variants of the application that differ in where the model is executed:

* The Neuton variant, which uses a CPU-based model, also called the Neuton model.
* The Axon variant, which uses an NPU-based model, also called the Axon model.

When connected to a PC, the device appears as a Bluetooth LE HID device, allowing recognized gestures to control media playback or presentation slides.
Based on accelerometer and gyroscope data, the nRF Edge AI model recognizes eight gesture classes:

* Swipe right
* Swipe left
* Double shake
* Double tap
* Rotation clockwise
* Rotation counter-clockwise
* No gestures (IDLE)
* Unknown gesture

The neural network model is trained using the `Nordic Edge AI Lab`_.
The whole process how to capture data and train the model is described in the `Nordic Edge AI Lab documentation`_.
You can also see `Gesture recognition use-case demo video`_.

Development kits
================

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Thingy53

      The `Nordic Thingy:53 <Nordic Thingy:53 Multi-protocol IoT prototyping platform_>`_  is an easy-to-use IoT prototyping platform.
      It allows to create prototypes and proofs-of-concept without building custom hardware.
      The Thingy:53 is built around the nRF5340 SoC, a dual-core wireless SoC.
      The processing power and memory size of its dual Arm Cortex-M33 processors enable it to run embedded machine learning (ML) models directly on the device.

      The Thingy:53 also includes multiple integrated sensors, such as environmental sensors, color and light sensors, accelerometers, and a magnetometer.
      It is powered by a rechargeable lithium-polymer (Li-Po) battery that can be charged through USB-C.
      There is also an external 4-pin JST connector compatible with the Stemma, Qwiic, and Grove standards for hardware accessories.

The `Bosch BMI270`_ is a 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope IMU sensor.
All development kits use the sensor to collect data for gesture recognition.

Setting up software environment
*******************************

For full instructions on preparing your development environment, see :ref:`setting_up_environment`.

User interface
**************

This section describes the user interface available on development kits in this application.

Buttons and LEDs
================

The project has two keyboard control modes: Presentation Control and Music Control.
Depending on the control mode, recognized gestures are mapped to different keyboard keys.
Switch between control modes by pressing the user button.

When Bluetooth LE HID pairing with MITM protection is enabled, the application also supports explicit passkey confirmation and rejection using the user button with short and long presses.

The following table explains the LED indications for control modes and Bluetooth connection states on each device, and shows which button switches between control modes:

Bluetooth LE HID passkey confirmation
=====================================

In Bluetooth HID mode, when ``CONFIG_BLE_MITM_AUTH=y`` and passkey confirmation is requested, the serial log prints the passkey and the available button actions.
The single user button changes its behavior temporarily while pairing confirmation is pending:

* **Short press** (< 500 ms): Reject pairing
* **Long press** (> 2000 ms): Confirm pairing

The mode-switch button behavior is restored after pairing is completed or rejected.

Configuration
*************

|config|

Choosing the model backend
==========================

The application supports two execution backends:

* `Neuton models`_ - Highly optimized models that run on the CPU.
* `Axon NPU`_ - Models that run on the Axon NPU (AI accelerator core).

The Neuton model is used by default on all boards that do not have the Axon NPU.
You can use the Axon model by enabling the ``CONFIG_NRF_EDGEAI_GESTURE_RECOGNITION_MODEL_AXON`` Kconfig option.

Choosing Bluetooth LE HID pairing security
==========================================

In Bluetooth HID mode, the pairing behavior is controlled by the ``CONFIG_BLE_MITM_AUTH`` Kconfig option:

* ``CONFIG_BLE_MITM_AUTH=y`` enables MITM-protected pairing.
   The application requests Bluetooth LE Security Level 4, and pairing uses passkey confirmation on the user button.
* ``CONFIG_BLE_MITM_AUTH=n`` disables MITM protection.
   The application requests Bluetooth LE Security Level 2, and pairing uses unauthenticated encrypted pairing without passkey confirmation.

This option is relevant only when the ``CONFIG_BLE_MODE_HID`` option is enabled.
By default, it is enabled in :file:`prj.conf` and disabled in :file:`prj_release.conf`.

Build types
===========

Each board directory contains per-board configuration files for different build types.
See :ref:`nrf:app_build_additions_build_types` and :ref:`nrf:cmake_options` for more information.
The application supports the following build types:

.. list-table:: Gesture Recognition build types
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Build type
     - File name
     - Description
   * - Debug (default)
     - :file:`prj.conf`
     - Debug version of the application with logging and assertions enabled. BLE HID MITM protection (``CONFIG_BLE_MITM_AUTH``) is enabled by default.
   * - Release
     - :file:`prj_release.conf`
     - Release version of the application with logging disabled, compiler optimizations, and reduced LED activity for lower power consumption. BLE HID MITM protection (``CONFIG_BLE_MITM_AUTH``) is disabled by default.
   * - Release without Bluetooth LE
     - :file:`prj_release_no_ble.conf`
     - Release version of the application without Bluetooth LE, but with serial logging enabled for diagnostics.

Choosing Bluetooth LE mode
==========================

The application supports four mutually exclusive Bluetooth LE modes.
Select one in the :file:`prj.conf` file or through ``menuconfig`` (Application Options → Bluetooth LE mode):

* Bluetooth HID mode - Used when the ``CONFIG_BLE_MODE_HID`` Kconfig option is enabled.
  The device is a Bluetooth keyboard that sends keystrokes based on recognized gestures.
  It is not available in data collection mode, which is the default mode when the ``CONFIG_DATA_COLLECTION_MODE`` Kconfig option is disabled.
* No Bluetooth LE mode - Used when the ``CONFIG_BLE_MODE_NONE`` Kconfig option is enabled.
  In this mode, Bluetooth is disabled.
  Inference results and data collection use serial connection only.
* Bluetooth LE NUS mode - Used when the ``CONFIG_BLE_MODE_NUS`` Kconfig option is enabled.
  In this mode, the device forwards raw IMU samples over the Nordic UART Service.
  This mode is available only in data collection mode, which is the default when the ``CONFIG_DATA_COLLECTION_MODE`` Kconfig option is enabled.
  For more information, see :ref:`building_firmware_for_data_collection`.
* Bluetooth LE GATT mode - Used when the ``CONFIG_BLE_MODE_GATT_CUSTOM`` Kconfig option is enabled.
  In this mode, the device exposes a custom GATT service called "neuton_gatt" that sends inference results in the format ``<class_label>,<probability>``.
  This mode is not available in data collection mode.

.. _building_firmware_for_data_collection:

Building firmware for data collection
=====================================

It is possible to create a build that outputs raw data from the accelerometer and gyro sensors on the serial port.
No inference is performed in this mode.
This allows to capture data for training new models and to test and implement new use cases.
The output consists of 16-bit integers separated by a comma, in the following order:

.. code-block::

   <acc_x>,<acc_y>,<acc_z>,<gyro_x>,<gyro_y>,<gyro_z>

Column headers are not included.
The output rate is the configured sampling frequency (default 100 Hz).

You can find raw datasets used for model training on the `training dataset`_ page.

1. To build this version, enable the following option in the :file:`prj.conf` file:

   .. code-block::

      CONFIG_DATA_COLLECTION_MODE=y
      CONFIG_BLE_MODE_NONE=y

#. If you want to forward the same data over Bluetooth LE using :ref:`nrf:nus_service_readme`, additionally switch from No BLE mode to NUS mode:

   .. code-block::

      CONFIG_DATA_COLLECTION_MODE=y
      CONFIG_BLE_MODE_NUS=y

   In this mode, you must have an additional development kit running the :ref:`Central UART sample <nrf:central_uart>` to receive the NUS data.

   .. note::
      When using Bluetooth LE NUS mode, some samples may be lost due to RF noise or increased distance between the device and the central.
      To help track lost samples, the application prepends a sequential ID to each sample transmitted over NUS.
      Use the :file:`scripts/check_nus_data.py` script to check for dropped samples and strip the ID from the received data.

Building and running
********************

.. |application path| replace:: :file:`applications/gesture_recognition`

.. include:: /includes/application_build_and_run.txt

Testing
=======

|test_application|

1. |connect_kit|
#. |connect_terminal_kit|
   Connect to the serial device printing console output.
#. When performing gestures with the device, the serial port terminal displays messages similar to the following:

   .. code-block:: console

      Predicted class: DOUBLE SHAKE, with probability 96 %
      BLE HID key sent successfully
      Predicted class: SWIPE RIGHT, with probability 99 %
      BLE HID key sent successfully
      Predicted class: SWIPE LEFT, with probability 99 %
      BLE HID key sent successfully
      Predicted class: ROTATION RIGHT, with probability 93 %
      BLE HID key sent successfully

   Once the device is running, Bluetooth LE advertising starts as a HID device and waits for a connection request from the PC.
   Devices can be connected in the same way as a regular Bluetooth keyboard.

#. Pair the Bluetooth device with your PC.
#. Once connected successfully, the serial port terminal returns log messages similar to the following:

   .. code-block::

      Connected 9C:B6:D0:C0:CE:FC (public)
      Security changed: 9C:B6:D0:C0:CE:FC (public) level 4

   With ``CONFIG_BLE_MITM_AUTH=y``, the connection is raised to Security Level 4 and the terminal prints the passkey and available button actions:

   .. code-block::

      Passkey for 9C:B6:D0:C0:CE:FC (public): 123456
      ===== Button Functionality (Pairing Confirmation Mode) =====
      Short press (< 500 ms): Reject pairing
      Long press  (> 2000 ms): Confirm pairing
      ==============================================

   Use a **long press** (> 2000 ms) on the user button to confirm the passkey, or a **short press** (< 500 ms) to reject it.

   With ``CONFIG_BLE_MITM_AUTH=n``, pairing does not require passkey confirmation and the terminal log shows Security Level 2 instead:

   .. code-block::

      Connected 9C:B6:D0:C0:CE:FC (public)
      Security changed: 9C:B6:D0:C0:CE:FC (public) level 2

   After Bluetooth connection, the device changes LED indication from red to green, or red to blue depending on the keyboard control mode.
   You can now use the device to control media playback or presentation slides by making gestures.

Making gestures
===============

This section shows the correct device orientation and motion for performing supported gestures.
The model was trained with a limited dataset.
For optimal gesture recognition across different users, follow the instructions carefully and train a new model with a larger dataset.

Make sure the default (initial) position of the device matches the following:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Thingy53

      .. figure:: images/initial_orientation_thingy.gif
