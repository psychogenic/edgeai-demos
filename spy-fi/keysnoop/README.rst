Wakeword and Keyword Spotting
#############################

This application demonstrates wakeword detection and keyword spotting from a digital microphone stream using |EAILib| and Axon-based inference.
It also features integrated model observability, allowing you to monitor and analyze inference metrics during operation.

Application overview
********************

The application samples single-channel 16 kHz audio from a PDM microphone and feeds it to nRF Edge AI models.
The wakeword phrase used by the bundled model is "Okay Nordic".
In wakeword detection stage, model output is postprocessed with a predictions history window.
Parameters used for postprocessing are prediction probability threshold, predictions history length and number of predictions above threshold in predictions history.
When a wakeword is detected, the application switches to keyword detection stage.

The bundled keyword spotting model supports the following keywords:

* Go
* Stop
* Up
* Down
* Yes
* No
* On
* Off
* Right
* Left

In the keyword spotting stage, the application smooths class probabilities using an exponential moving average and reports a detection when class-specific criteria are met.
After period without any keywords spotted the application switches back to wakeword stage.

You can also configure the application to stay in one of these stages using the application-specific Kconfig options.

Observability
=============

The application collects runtime observability metrics using the :ref:`nrf_edgeai_obsv_lib`.
Enable the ``CONFIG_MODELS_OBSERVABILITY`` Kconfig option to wire metrics into the bundled models.
Each model stage owns its observability context and Memfault transport binding in the :file:`src/ww/wakeword.c` and :file:`src/kws/kws.c` files.

The wakeword stage only registers the :ref:`nrf_edgeai_obsv_metrics_built_in_probability` metric.
The keyword spotting stage registers the :ref:`nrf_edgeai_obsv_metrics_built_in_probability` and :ref:`nrf_edgeai_obsv_metrics_built_in_transition` metrics.

Metrics are collected every 24 hours (see the ``CONFIG_NRF_EDGEAI_OBSV_MEMFAULT_AUTO_COLLECT`` Kconfig option) and sent to the `Memfault`_ using `Custom Data Recording <Memfault Custom Data Recording_>`_ registered by the :ref:`nrf_edgeai_obsv_lib`.

Replacing models
================

You can replace the bundled models using the `Text to Wake Word Detection <Nordic Edge AI Lab Wake Word Detection_>`_ feature of the `Nordic Edge AI Lab`_ or one of `ready-to-use models <Nordic Edge AI Lab ready-to-use models_>`_.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Wakeword detection model

      To replace the model used in wakeword detection stage complete the following steps:

      1. Replace the files inside :file:`src/ww/nrf_edgeai_generated` directory with files downloaded from `Nordic Edge AI Lab`_.
      #. In :c:func:`ww_init`, set the ``ww_model`` pointer using the model getter from the generated files.
      #. Adjust the Kconfig options to tune wakeword detection postprocessing to your model.


   .. group-tab:: Keyword spotting model

      To replace the model used in keyword spotting stage complete the following steps:

      1. Replace the files inside :file:`src/kws/nrf_edgeai_generated` directory with files downloaded from `Nordic Edge AI Lab`_.
      #. In :c:func:`kws_init`, set the ``kws_model`` pointer using the model getter from the generated files.
      #. Update the ``keyword_detection_ctxs`` array in the :file:`src/kws/kws.c` file with keyword labels from :file:`src/kws/nrf_edgeai_generated/nrf_edgeai_user_model_labels.h` file and thresholds for keyword spotting.
      #. When using the observability feature, set the ``CONFIG_NRF_EDGEAI_OBSV_MAX_CLASSES`` Kconfig option to number of keywords spotted plus 2 for auxiliary classes.
      #. Adjust the Kconfig options to tune keyword spotting postprocessing to selected model.

Requirements
************

The application supports the following development kit:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

The application also requires PDM digital microphone connected to the pins specified in the :file:`boards/nrf54lm20dk_nrf54lm20b_cpuapp.overlay` file.
The application is expecting audio data to be provided on left channel.

Pin mapping
===========

The application was tested with an `Adafruit PDM MEMS Microphone`_ module.
It can be powered from 1.8V ``VDD:IO`` supply.
The following table show how to connect this module to the DK:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Adafurit DMIC
     - nRF54LM20 DK
   * - ``3V``
     - ``VDD:IO``
   * - ``GND``
     - ``GND``
   * - ``SEL``
     - ``GND``
   * - ``CLK``
     - ``P1.4``
   * - ``DAT``
     - ``P1.5``

The ``SEL`` pin is responsible for selecting audio channel and connecting it to ground selects left channel.

To use other microphones, adapt configuration parameters of PDM in the :file:`src/dmic.c` file.

User interface
***************

LED0:
   Behavior depends on the selected application mode:

   * Lit when keyword spotting stage is active in wakeword-gated keyword spotting mode.
   * Blinks for one second when wakeword is detected in wakeword only mode.
   * Stays off in keyword spotting only mode.

LED1:
   Blinks for one second on each keyword spotted.

UART30 (VCOM0):
   Prints runtime state messages:

   * ``Waiting for wakeword``
   * ``Wakeword detected``
   * ``Waiting for keywords``
   * ``Keyword spotted: <name>``
   * ``Keyword spotting window timeout``

Configuration options
=====================

.. options-from-kconfig::
   :show-type:

Additional configuration
========================

Check and configure the following library options that are used by the application:

* ``CONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS_PROJECT_KEY`` - A key to your `Memfault`_ project
* ``CONFIG_NRF_EDGEAI_OBSV_MAX_CLASSES`` - Number of classes the observed model predicts
* ``CONFIG_NRF_EDGEAI_OBSV_MEMFAULT_AUTO_COLLECT_INTERVAL_SEC`` - Interval of automatic metrics collection.
  For testing, use a shorter interval and enable server debug mode for the device in the  `Memfault`_ dashboard.

Build types
===========

For build type overview and guidance on how to run them, see :ref:`nrf:app_build_additions_build_types` and :ref:`nrf:cmake_options`.
The application supports the following build types:
